PiC Data Science Challenge
==========================

This is a rough outline of the methodology and approach used in completing the data science challenge.

## First steps

- Removed the obviously unnecessary/irrelevant columns from CSV file manually: dates of application stages, other things that appeared to be more administrative than useful.
- Take various complex strings to booleans etc
- Nicer column names

## Plot ideas

- Sankey diagram! Nice way to represent percentages of applicants getting through.
