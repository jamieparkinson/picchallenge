Biases and Metrics in the Recruitment Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Reducing bias towards disadvantaged and minority groups in the recruitment
 process is key to building more a more diverse and fairer business.
 We will look at potential biases in the graduate scheme recruitment process
 at Company X.

This plot, known as an alluvial or Sankey plot, shows changes over the recruitme
nt process in the relative percentage of applicants, separated by gender,
 sexual orientation, white/non-white ethnicity and, finally, by PiC's advantaged

 We have excluded applications that were withdrawn.

No black applicants make it to the offer stage but so few apply that we
 can't claim that this is significant.

Taking a Closer Look
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've looked at how applicants proceed through the recruitment process.
 What turns out to be more interesting is looking at how likely applicants
 are to drop out.

Is the recruitment process unpleasant or intimidating for some minorities?

This is an important question to address.
 The chart overleaf shows the percentages of dropouts from each of the minority
 groups above.

Actually, there is a significant difference for gender too.
 An analysis of the data

How Else Can We Help?

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to analysing data to look at bias, PiC can offer extra help
 in the recruitment process.

Whilst our scoring system looks only at a candidate's performance in the
